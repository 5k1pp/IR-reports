# 🔴 Slingway Inc. Web Server Compromise: Unauthorized Access and Data Exfiltration Incident

## 📌 Incident Summary
On **July 26, 2023**, Slingway Inc., a leading toy company, detected suspicious activity on its e-commerce web server, leading to a SOC investigation. The attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the server’s admin panel, using tools like the **Nmap Scripting Engine** and **Gobuster** for directory enumeration. They accessed the `/admin-login.php` page, successfully brute-forced the admin credentials (`admin:thx1138`), and gained unauthorized access.

Once inside, the attacker uploaded a malicious file and extracted database credentials via **Local File Inclusion (LFI) 🛑**. They accessed phpMyAdmin and exported the `customer_credit_cards` database while also inserting additional fraudulent credit card credentials into it. The attacker's **IP address** was identified as `10.0.2.15`, with **1867 failed requests** logged during the attack.
